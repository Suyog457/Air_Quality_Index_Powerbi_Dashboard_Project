🌍 Project Spotlight: Air Quality Index  Report 🌍

I'm excited to share my latest Power BI project, titled "Air Quality index Report," where I dove deep into the analysis of air quality data across different regions. This project was an eye-opener, revealing the critical impact of air pollution on both our environment and public health.

🔑 Key Points:-

Comprehensive analysis of air quality indices (AQI) across multiple cities and timeframes. Identification of trends and patterns in pollutant levels, including PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO2. Visualization of air quality data through interactive and dynamic dashboards.

🎯 Objectives:-

To understand the variations in air quality across different regions and over time. To highlight the correlation between industrial activities, traffic, and rising pollution levels. To provide actionable insights that can aid policymakers and environmental agencies in decision-making.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used :-

Data Collection:-

Leveraged datasets from reputable environmental monitoring agencies. Data Processing: Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query and DAX in Power BI. Visualization: Created interactive dashboards with slicers, maps, and charts to depict AQI trends and pollutant levels.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀:-

📍𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:-

Imported and cleansed AQI datasets using Power Query Editor.
Built relationships between AQI data and a date dimension for time-based analysis.

📍𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗔𝗫:-

Created calculated columns and measures for detailed analysis, including average and max AQI.

📍𝗗𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻:-

Developed interactive visuals like trend charts, regional comparisons, and custom maps.
Enhanced aesthetics with custom visuals designed in PowerPoint.

📍𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:-

Applied data reduction techniques and optimized DAX calculations for better performance.

📍𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁:-

Published the dashboard to Power BI Service with real-time data refresh and role-based access control.

⌛𝗢𝘂𝘁𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲:-

The final dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of air quality trends and anomalies, with the ability to quickly identify areas of concern. The use of advanced Power BI features such as DAX, custom visuals, and optimized performance ensures that the dashboard is both powerful and user-friendly, making it an invaluable tool for decision-makers and analysts alike.
